# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

This repository is intentionally small, opinionated, and conservative.  
Changes are welcome — but **only when they preserve the core philosophy**.

Please read this before opening a PR.

## What this repo is trying to preserve

The skills in this repo are designed to:

- encode **professional judgement**, not workflows,
- surface **signals**, not enforce gates,
- leave **minimal durable artefacts** without bureaucracy,
- keep **humans in control at all times**.

If a contribution moves the system toward:
- automation of decisions,
- project management,
- governance or compliance,
- or mandatory process,

it is likely out of scope.

## What makes a good contribution

Good contributions usually:

- clarify wording or intent,
- tighten scope or boundaries,
- remove ambiguity or overreach,
- improve consistency across skills,
- fix issues discovered through real use.

Real-world examples, failure cases, and friction reports are especially valuable.

## What does *not* belong here

Please do **not** submit changes that:

- add workflow state (status, priority, assignees),
- introduce enforcement or blocking behaviour,
- require mandatory documentation or approvals,
- add automation that removes human choice,
- increase ceremony without clear evidence of need.

If in doubt, start a discussion before coding.

## How to propose changes

1. **Describe the problem**
   - What went wrong in real usage?
   - What friction did you observe?

2. **Describe the smallest change**
   - What minimal adjustment would help?
   - What behaviour would improve?

3. **Explain what is *not* changing**
   - Explicitly state what authority is *not* being added.

Changes that are small, focused, and reversible are strongly preferred.

## Tone and style

- Be clear and precise.
- Prefer plain language over cleverness.
- Avoid jargon unless it reduces ambiguity.
- Assume sceptical, experienced readers.

---

## Final rule of thumb

> If a change makes the skills feel more powerful, more automatic, or more authoritative, it’s probably the wrong change.

When in doubt: **do less**.
